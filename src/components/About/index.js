          Welcome! I am Graham Clayton (the one on the right), a newly certified
          Full-stack developer from the University of North Carolina Chapel
          hill. I am 19 years old and have been a part of the workforce since I
          was 14. I saw an opportunity to have money that someone my age did not
          usually have and so I took it, and that is what I believe I am doing
          now as well. The field of "Web Development" is an ever-expanding land
          of opportunity and I have been given the privilege to access it before
          most do. While I may not be overly confident, I promise that with
          guidance there is nothing that will get in my way to become a
          top-level developer for whoever is willing to invest in me.
        </p>

          Now a little about me personally, I spent my whole educational
          experience being homeschooled and while it kept me from some of the
          more social aspects of public school I was able to experience so much
          by living in another country, growing up doing outreach work, and
          committing to a large number of musical theatre productions from
          2017-2019. I hope that this career will be the boost I need to achieve
          what I want to achieve and chase what I want to chase. Big plans to
          come and I think coding is the future I need to get there.
